</title>
<meta name="description" content="Business interruption insurance helps replace the lost income and other expenses if a business is forced to temporarily shut down due to a covered peril that affects its commercial property. Covered perils typically include natural disasters such as fire, wind, or lightning, as well as theft and falling objects.Business interruption: While commercial property pays for actual physical damages or losses, BI covers lost net income due to the closure of the business while repairs are underway. These policies may cover rent or lease payments, relocation costs, employee wages, taxes, and loan payments.Business interruption insurance covers the cost of rental and lease payments while your business isnt making money. Example: A fire damages an electronics store, making it impossible for the business to serve customers. While the business is closed for renovations, it still needs to make rental payments on the store.Business interruption risk refers to the financial loss a company suffers when its operations are disrupted. This loss includes both observable components, such as reduced sales and increased cost of working, and hidden components, such as loss of future revenue streams due to potential reputational damage.1﻿ Most business interruption insurance policies define this period as the date that the covered peril began until the date that the damaged property is physically repaired and returned to the same condition that existed prior to the disaster. There may also be a waiting period of 48 to 72 hours.">
