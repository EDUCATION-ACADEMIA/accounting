Replacement price is the price at which materials would be replaced. market price on the date of Issue is method is used when it is designed to reflect current prices in cost.Definition. 1. The replacement cost method involves arriving at an assets value by reference to the present-day cost, in an arms-length transaction, of replacing that asset with a similar asset in a similar condition 1 (plus, if appropriate, payment of any taxes due).In other words, the materials are issued at the latest cost price. The closing stock of materials are valued at the oldest cost price. In case of a rising price LIFO method is suitable because material is issued at current price.In times of rising prices, LIFO method of pricing issues is suitable because materials are issued at the current market prices which are high. This method thus helps in showing a lower profit because of increased charge to production during periods of rising prices and lower profit reduces burden of income-tax.Here we detail about the following eight methods of pricing of issue of materials: (1) Replacement Cost Method, (2) Fixed Price Method, (3) Standard Price Method, (4) Inflated Price Method, (5) Highest in First Out (HIFO) Method, (6) Next-in-First Out (NIFO) Method, (7) Moving Average Method and (8) Base Stock Method.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Replacement price method is also known as market price method. Replacement price is the price at which materials would be replaced. market price on the date of Issue is method is used when it is designed to reflect current prices in cost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Definition. 1. The replacement cost method involves arriving at an assetâ€™s value by reference to the present-day cost, in an arms-length transaction, of replacing that asset with a similar asset in a similar condition 1 (plus, if appropriate, payment of any taxes due).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In other words, the materials are issued at the latest cost price. The closing stock of materials are valued at the oldest cost price. In case of a rising price LIFO method is suitable because material is issued at current price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:

This method thus helps in showing a lower profit because of increased charge to production during periods of rising prices and lower profit reduces burden of income-tax.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
