In the corporate world, a subsidiary is a company that belongs to another company, which is usually referred to as the parent company or the holding company.

Wholly-owned subsidiaries allow the parent company to diversify their product lines, streamline management, and possibly reduce risk. By its nature, a wholly-owned subsidiary has no obligations to minority shareholders.A conglomerate is a corporation made up of several different, independent businesses. In a conglomerate, one company owns a controlling stake in smaller companies that each conduct business operations separately. Conglomerates can be created in several ways, including mergers or acquisitions.The owning company, which is called the parent or holding company, usually owns more than 50% of its voting stock (it can be half plus one share more) of the subsidiary. Despite the stake in ownership, the subsidiary and parent companies remain separate legal entities for liability, tax, and regulatory reasons. 1.">
