<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The rate established at the beginning of a period that uses estimated overhead and an allocation factor such as estimated direct labor, and that is used to assign overhead cost to jobs is the: Predetermined overhead rate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The predetermined overhead rate is determined at the beginning of the year by taking into consideration the budgeted overhead cost and overhead cost drivers such as direct labor hours or direct labor cost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A pre-determined overhead rate is the rate used to apply manufacturing overhead to work-in-process inventory. The pre-determined overhead rate is calculated before the period begins. The first step is to estimate the amount of the activity base that will be required to support operations in the upcoming period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Monitoring relative expenses: Predetermined overhead rate provides companies with a percentage they can monitor on a quarterly, monthly and even weekly basis, with the amount of base and expense being proportionate to each other. This can help you ensure costs aren’t escalating.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A predetermined overhead rate is calculated at the start of the accounting period by dividing the estimated manufacturing overhead by the estimated activity base. The predetermined overhead rate is then applied to production to facilitate determining a standard cost for a product.
