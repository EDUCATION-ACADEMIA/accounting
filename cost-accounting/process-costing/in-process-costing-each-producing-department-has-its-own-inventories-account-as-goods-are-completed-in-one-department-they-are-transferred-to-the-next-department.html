</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Process costing is a costing method or an operational type of costing in which a manufacturer tracks the cost of production of a sequence of continuous or repetitive processes required to produce a product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Transferred-in costs are the costs accumulated by the product at any given point in production. They are “transferred in” to the new business department that receives the partially finished product and is responsible for continuing the production process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Process costing is used when output is produced in a continuous process system, and it is difficult to separate individual units of output.
