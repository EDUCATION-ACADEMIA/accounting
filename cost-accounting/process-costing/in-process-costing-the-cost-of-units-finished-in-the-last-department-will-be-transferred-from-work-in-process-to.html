<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-WIP refers to the raw materials, labor, and overhead costs incurred for products that are at various stages of the production process. WIP is a component of the inventory asset account on the balance sheet. These costs are subsequently transferred to the finished goods account and eventually to the cost of sales.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Transferred-in costs are the costs accumulated by the product at any given point in production. They are “transferred in” to the new business department that receives the partially finished product and is responsible for continuing the production process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-To calculate the goods transferred out, simply take the units transferred out times the sum of the two equivalent unit costs (materials and conversion) because all items transferred to the next department are complete with respect to materials and conversion, so each unit brings all its costs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Transferred-in goods are treated as if they are a separate material category that is added at the beginning of the process for the equivalent units and unit cost computations. The transferred-in units have 100% of the work and costs of the prior process.
