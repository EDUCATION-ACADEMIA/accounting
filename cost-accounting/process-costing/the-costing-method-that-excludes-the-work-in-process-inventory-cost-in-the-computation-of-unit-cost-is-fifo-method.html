<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What is FIFO costing? In simplest terms, FIFO (first-in, first-out) costing allows you to track the cost of an item/SKU based on its cost at purchase order receipt, and apply this cost against each shipment of the item until the receipt quantity is exhausted.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The first-in-first-out (FIFO) method keeps beginning inventory costs separate from current period costs and assumes that beginning inventory units are completed and transferred out before the units started during the current period are completed and transferred out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Costs of units started and completed: you will take the equivalent units calculated for units started and completed x the cost per equivalent unit for materials, labor and overhead (or conversion). The sum of these 3 will be the cost of units completed and transferred which is also known as cost of goods manufactured.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-weighted average method: combines beginning inventory costs (prior period work) with costs from current period work. 2. first-in, first-out (FIFO) method: separates beginning inventory costs (prior period work) from costs of current period work.
