<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If the units in the beginning Work-in-Process Inventory are greater than the units in the ending Work-in-Process Inventory, then the units transferred out are: more than the units started during the period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Charley Companyâ€™s Assembly Department has materials cost at $2 per unit and conversion cost at $4 per unit. There are 20, 000 units in ending work in process, all of which are 70% complete as to conversion costs and 100% complete as to materials.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The equivalent units of production is the sum of units completed and transferred out and the equivalent units of ending work in process inventory (5, 000 units X 60%) or 20, 000 + 3, 000 = 23, 000 units. Equivalent units of production measure the amount of work that should be completed during a period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An equivalent unit of conversion costs is equal to the amount of conversion costs required to: start and complete a unit. In the computation of the manufacturing cost per equivalent unit, the weighted-average method of process costing considers: current costs plus cost of beginning Work-in-Process Inventory.
