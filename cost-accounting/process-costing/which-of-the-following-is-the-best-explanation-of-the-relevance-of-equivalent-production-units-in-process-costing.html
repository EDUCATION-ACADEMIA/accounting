<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Answer» B. The conversion partly completed units into an equivalent number of completed units in order that costs may be shared on an equitable basis.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Option d is the correct answer In a process costing system, the output of one process becomes the input for another process so to make a unit 100% complete and ready to move to the next stage, equivalent units of production need to be calculated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Equivalent units are notional whole units that are equivalent to the number of incomplete units adjusted for their stage of completion. For example, if there are 200 incomplete units in a process at the end of a period and they are 75% complete then this is equivalent to 150 (200 × 0.75) whole (complete) units.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer: The equivalent units of production needed in a process costing system. It is so because the company is required to know the cost of each single unit of the product to decide the selling proce per unit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An equivalent unit of production is an expression of the amount of work done by a manufacturer on units of output that are partially completed at the end of an accounting period. Basically the fully completed units and the partially completed units are expressed in terms of fully completed units.
